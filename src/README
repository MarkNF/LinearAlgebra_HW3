To compile program, use the following:

	javac *.java

Once compiled, run my program with the
following command:

	java Main [filename]

I have included 8 test input files of various
dimensions and solutions. The solutions to these
matrices are as follows:

input1.txt = 5x5 1 solution
input2.txt = 3x4 no solution
input3.txt = 2x4 infinite solutions
input4.txt = 5x5 infinite solutions
input5.txt = 2x3 infinite solutions
input6.txt = 4x2 1 solution
input7.txt = 4x7 infinite solutinos
input8.txt = 4x7 no solution

The input files parse input according
to the following:

[number of rows]
[number of columns]
[solution]
[m x n matrix]

For example:

3		// m-value
4		// n-value
1 2 3 4		// solution
1 1 0		// matrix
2 2 4		// matrix
0 1 4		// matrix
5 3 1		// matrix

My procedure:

First, I stored the input matrix into a matrix object and performed elimination
on the matrix. At this point, I determined what class the matrix fell under using
it's rank. I did this according to the chart in chapter 3 of the text labelled 
'The four possibilities for equations depend on the rankr').

From this point, I could limit the operations on the elimination matrix. For example,
if I know it has 1 solution, I could simply do back-substitution to find solution.
If I know it has infinite solutions, I could continue to find the reduced echelon for
matrix and deternine to particular and special solutions.
